# Java-CS111A
Class assignments from several years ago for CCSF111A taught at City College of San Francisco. 2nd posting of the same repository due to the last one getting hit with a DMCA copyright strike for uploading Java For Everyone textbook. This one doesn't have any textbooks. The assignments in this repository are intended for people to look at the code, study it and modify it before submitting it to any of their teachers. When i did this assignments I wasn't aware that you are supposed to leave comments throughout the code so that other people can quickly understand what the programs do and how they work. I gave up on coding years ago. I don't want to let all of my hard work be for  nothing and go to waste so I post it online so that other people can hopefully benefit from it. I figure that very likely if you are looking at my code your teacher isn't doing a very good job teaching. Just like my CS teachers weren't doing a good job teaching and I ended up spending most of my time on Github and Stackoverflow looking for tip.
